How do we select collisions along a road?

request collision tiles at zoom level 16 (maybe 17 or 18? not sure yet)

Tests: Which zoom level?

zoom 16
74 tiles
58371 features
32100 ms

zoom 17
154 tiles
58371 features
13729 ms

zoom 18
330 tiles
58371 features
13333 ms

zoom 19
722 tiles
58371 features
13033 ms

why did I get the same number of features each time??? maybe it's just requesting the zoom 16 tile instead of generating 17, 18, or 19 level tiles. That would be why it took the same amount of time for each successive zoom level. I'll have to manually generate tiles all the way to 19 with tippecanoe.

tippecanoe -o philly-crashes.mbtiles -f -l collision -n 'All Philly Crashes' -z 19 -Z 16 -b 0 -g 0 -r 0 philly-crashes.geojson

Maybe we should select along a route? https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/example/v1.0.0/mapbox-directions/

browserify -s TrafficRoute ./src/collisions.js > getCollisions.js
